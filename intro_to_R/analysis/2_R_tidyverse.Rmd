# Data frames and tibbles

Data frames are similar to tables. They are very handy for storing and processing observations, as each column can hold data of different type.
Let's read a table with results of an experiment.
Tibbles are a tidyverse extended version of data.frames and they use their own, simpler syntax. We will start by loading a library tidyverse - a bundle with many data processing libraries.

```{r}
library( tidyverse )
```

We'll read input data directly from a webpage. We will use the data about immune cells ( collected by flow cytometry ) from COVID patients: https://www.immunophenotype.org/ :

```{r}
covid_data <- read_csv( "https://www.immunophenotype.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020-06-30flow_sero_cyto__ifnaexport.csv" )

#How big is this dataset? ###
covid_data 

#print a useful summary
glimpse( covid_data )

nrow( covid_data )
ncol( covid_data )

```

### Accessing data in a tibble
You can use the same method as for data frames:
```{r}
covid_data[ 1:3, c( 1, 4, 55 ) ]

#what type is data in the columns Clinical_sample and `B_01/CD45_01 |freq` ?
covid_data[ 1:3, "Clinical_sample" ]

#But you can also access specific column with the operator $ ( as for list ). #type covid_data$ and hit tab - RStudio will suggest you options

#Additional_point
#Have a look on column names of covid_data. Some of them contain 'forbidden' characters - spaces, "|". When using them, you will need to quote them in "" or in `` ( depending on context )

```

### Operator %>%

In R we often perform whole series of operations: for example subset a table by rows and columns, compute an average of some columns, add a number to this average. Operator %>% ( pipe ) helps to make it more legible by using an output of the function before pipe as input of the function after pipe.

```{r}

b <- 1:10


b %>%    #take b
 .[ 1:4 ] %>%   # take first 4 elements of b
 mean( . ) %>%  #compute a mean
 + 3 %>%   #add 3
paste( "result is", . ) %>% #add text
 print( ) 


#This is the same as:
print( paste ( "result is", mean( b[ 1:4 ] ) + 3 ) )

#what will be the result of this operation?
a <- 4

a %>%
 sqrt( ) %>%
 .^2

```

Pipes are especially helpful for filtering and summarizing data.

### Selecting columns and filtering rows in tibbles

One can select columns and filter rows for specific values with functions select( ) and filter( ). For filtering helpful are:
 == , >, >= , <, <= , != , %in%. Select let's you also easily change column order and give a column a new name when selecting

```{r, eval=FALSE}

#prepare a smaller table with columns "T_01/CD45_01 |freq" and "Memory_B_01/B_01 |freq"
covid_data %>%
 select( "Clinical_sample", "T_01/CD45_01 |freq", "Memory_B_01/B_01 |freq" )

#Now changing column order
covid_data %>%
 select( "T_01/CD45_01 |freq", "Memory_B_01/B_01 |freq", "Clinical_sample" )

#With tibbles, quotes around well formed names are unnecessary. Names with spaces, / and other bad characters require backticks `` or quotes ( "" or '' )
covid_data %>%
 select( Clinical_sample, `T_01/CD45_01 |freq`, `Memory_B_01/B_01 |freq` )


#Find all samples with less than 10% of T cells in CD45 cells
covid_data %>%
 select( Clinical_sample, `T_01/CD45_01 |freq` ) %>%
 filter( `T_01/CD45_01 |freq` < 0.1 )


#Find frequencies of T and B cells for sample "p028n01" ( this is 'patient 28, sample 1' )
covid_data %>%
 select( Clinical_sample, `T_01/CD45_01 |freq`, `Memory_B_01/B_01 |freq` ) %>%
 filter( Clinical_sample == "p028n01" )

#Now you. How many samples has patient p001? Add missing parts of the code
#covid_data 
# filter( )


```



```{r elective_part}
#Merge sample information with clinical information, joining two tables by patient ids. From the big table above we are taking only columns NOT containing MFI measurements or derived values ( frequencies, ratios ) cell 


patient_info <- read_csv( "data/20-07-25patients_metadatav2.csv" )

columns_to_take_from_big_data <- colnames( covid_data ) %>%grep( pattern = "Median|Ratio|freq", value = TRUE, invert = T )

covid_data_annotated <- covid_data %>%
 select( Clinical_sample, patient_id, columns_to_take_from_big_data ) %>%
 left_join( patient_info, ., by = c( "patient_id" ) )

write_csv( covid_data_annotated, file = "data/covid_data_annotated.csv" )

```


```{r}
covid_data_annotated <- read_csv( "data/covid_data_annotated.csv" )

colnames( covid_data_annotated )

#Select a subset of columns, giving them handy names.

#columns to choose: "Time_03/Cells_03/Singlets1_03/Singlets2_03/Live_03/CD45p_03/T_03/CD3p_gdn_03/CD4_03 | Count_back"
# "Time_03/Cells_03/Singlets1_03/Singlets2_03/Live_03/CD45p_03/T_03/CD3p_gdn_03/CD8_03 | Count_back"


covid_data_annotated_small <- covid_data_annotated %>%
 select( Clinical_sample, patient_id, sex, age, status = class_dss, 
   CD4 = "Time_03/Cells_03/Singlets1_03/Singlets2_03/Live_03/CD45p_03/T_03/CD3p_gdn_03/CD4_03 | Count_back", 
   CD8 = "Time_03/Cells_03/Singlets1_03/Singlets2_03/Live_03/CD45p_03/T_03/CD3p_gdn_03/CD8_03 | Count_back" )


#Add a column Tcell_freq by dividing values in 
```

### Adding new columns
New columns get added by the function mutate( )

```{r}

#Ad a new column: with ratio of CD4 cells to CD8 cells
covid_data_annotated_small <- covid_data_annotated_small %>%
 mutate( CD4_CD8_ratio = CD4/CD8 )

```

### Summarising
Function summarise( ) gives one number summaries
```{r}
#summarise: what summarie
covid_data_annotated_small %>%
 summarise( mean_CD4 = mean( CD4 ), 
   mean_CD8 = mean( CD8 ), 
   median_CD4 = median( CD4 ), 
   median_CD8 = median( CD8 ), 
   max_ratio = max( CD4_CD8_ratio ), 
   min_ratio = min( CD4_CD8_ratio ), 
   N = n( ), individuals = n_distinct( patient_id ) )

#This did not work as intended - many functions require special dealing with missing values ( NA ). For many, it requires a special argument na.rm = T

covid_data_annotated_small %>%
 summarise( mean_CD4 = mean( CD4, na.rm = T ), 
   mean_CD8 = mean( CD8, na.rm = T ), 
   median_CD4 = median( CD4, na.rm = T ), 
   median_CD8 = median( CD8, na.rm = T ), 
   max_ratio = max( CD4_CD8_ratio, na.rm = T ), 
   min_ratio = min( CD4_CD8_ratio, na.rm = T ), 
   N = n( ), individuals = n_distinct( patient_id ) )

```

### Grouping

Grouping data by a column value permits to perform operations per group. You can group by more than 1 column. To remove grouping: ungroup(). To treat each row separately use rowwise()

```{r}
#Group by sex and perform the same calculations as before
 covid_data_annotated_small %>%
 group_by( sex ) %>%
 summarise( mean_CD4 = mean( CD4, na.rm = T ), 
   mean_CD8 = mean( CD8, na.rm = T ), 
   median_CD4 = median( CD4, na.rm = T ), 
   median_CD8 = median( CD8, na.rm = T ), 
   max_ratio = max( CD4_CD8_ratio, na.rm = T ), 
   min_ratio = min( CD4_CD8_ratio, na.rm = T ), 
   N = n( ), individuals = n_distinct( patient_id ) )

#Now the same, but group by sex and disease status
covid_data_annotated_small %>%
 group_by( sex, status ) %>%
 summarise( mean_CD4 = mean( CD4, na.rm = T ), 
   mean_CD8 = mean( CD8, na.rm = T ), 
   median_CD4 = median( CD4, na.rm = T ), 
   median_CD8 = median( CD8, na.rm = T ), 
   max_ratio = max( CD4_CD8_ratio, na.rm = T ), 
   min_ratio = min( CD4_CD8_ratio, na.rm = T ), 
   N = n( ), individuals = n_distinct( patient_id ) )

#Now you: fill in the code. Count number of samples per individual ( group by individual and use n( ) ).

covid_data_annotated_small 
 group_by( sex, status ) %>%
 summarise( N = ) 
 
# What was the biggest number of samples per individual?
covid_data_annotated_small 
 group_by( sex, status ) %>%
 summarise( N = ) %>%
 summarise ( max_no_of_samples = )

```



## ggplot
The package ggplot2 and its many related packages allows to get beautiful graphics, change your plots quickly and also 
fine-tune details. It is based on the concept of layers- you can add many charts from one dataset to a plot. Each layer is prepared with the function geom_XXX, where XXX is type of plot. Information from your input data is mapped to different aesthetics: for example CD4 number is presented on y axis, age group on x, sex as colour. Parts of the ggplot( ) are added with + .

```{r}
covid_data_annotated_small %>%
 ggplot( ) + 
 geom_point( aes( x = age, y = CD4, col = sex ) )

#Now the same, but plotting as boxplots
covid_data_annotated_small %>%
 ggplot( ) + 
 geom_boxplot( aes( x = age, y = CD4, fill = sex ) )


#Now you. Plot CD8s by status



```

## lapply()

lapply() applies a function on each elemment of a list separately  HERE I AM NOT SURE WHETHER TO NOT SWITCH TO map() or even a for() loop

```{r extension_lapply}

my_list <- list( 1:3, 4:8, 0:2 )
lapply( list( 1:3, 4:8, 0:2 ), max )  #computes max of each list element and returns a list with results

#You can use a ready-made function or make your own:
add_flower <- function( word ){
 paste( word, "flower" )
}

lapply( 1:3, add_flower )



```
