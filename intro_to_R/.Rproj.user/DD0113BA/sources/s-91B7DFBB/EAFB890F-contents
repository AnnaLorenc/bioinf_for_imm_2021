#Challenges

#### Challenge 1

 Which of the following are valid R variable names?
```{r, eval=FALSE}
 min_height
 max.height
 _age
 .mass
 MaxLength
 min-length
 2widths
 celsius2kelvin
```


#### Challenge 2

What will be the value of each  variable  after each statement in the following program?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
 mass <- 47.5
 age <- 122
 mass <- mass * 2.3
 age <- age - 20
```


#### Challenge 3

Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to compare mass to age. Is mass larger than age?


#### Challenge 4

Clean up your working environment by deleting the mass and age variables.

#### Challenge 5

Make a matrix, this time containing the numbers 1:50,
with 5 columns and 10 rows.
Did the `matrix` function fill your matrix by column, or by
row, as its default behaviour?
See if you can figure out how to change this.
(hint: read the documentation for `matrix`!)

#### Challenge 6

Install the following packages: `ggplot2`, `plyr`, `gapminder`


#### Challenge 7
Start by making a vector with the numbers 1 through 26.
Multiply the vector by 2, and give the resulting vector
names A through Z (hint: there is a built in vector called `LETTERS`)


#### Challenge 8
Prepare a data.frame with whatever information you want. It should have at least 3 columns and at least 5 rows. Make sure one column contains numeric values and  one character values. 

#### Challenge 9
Install a package stick from the github and play with plotStick() function.

```{r libraries, include=TRUE,  eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE, prompt=TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
# install stick package from github - with the function install_github()
#from the package devtools. This package was created by Francis Smart.
install_github("EconometricsBySimulation/R-Graphics/Stick-Figures/stick")
library(stick)
#And now you can:
plotStick(1,1,xlim=c(0,2),ylim=c(-2,+3),
          hat=TRUE,
          arms="wave",
          gender="female",
          face="happy",
          cex=10,
          col="purple")
#Play with parameters! Tip: check in the function help what are the possibilities.
```
